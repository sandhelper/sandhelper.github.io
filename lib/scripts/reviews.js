This company was wonderful to work with. They dropped it off and picked it up. The batteries were dependable. Highly recommend."

I can not stress enough how amazing this motorized wheelchair is. This was a game changer for us and completely made our trip. The customer service was amazing, they responded within minutes and were so helpful. we stored the SandHelper in the lobby of our hotel with no problem, it came with 2 batteries and a charger and each battery has an average range of 4 miles. We were at a hotel on the beach, so we didn't even finish the first battery. Seriously, I can not stress enough how amazing this was and will recommend this to literally anyone who asks. It also helps that it was super entertaining for the kids :)"

I will definitely rent next time I come to the beach. It was also great how they bring it right to you and pick it up."

He rode the sandhelper and was able to spend 3 days enjoying our children, grandchildren, and cousins. He would have been unable to leave the bench on the boardwalk Without the sandhelper. Nick, the designer, owner and renter was exceptionally responsive. He called us back immediately, gave us instructions and answered all our questions. The video, accompanying the site on line gave very cleat instructions. Nick had the sand helper waiting for us on our arrival at our hotel, and he picked it up from our hotel after we left. The sandhelper was also able to be used for walks on the boardwalk. We definitely would recommend renting the sandhelper!"

Why can't they have 6 Stars? Anyone who has mobility issues, or a family member with mobility issues, Sand Helper makes sure that they get to participate in the fun as well! Thank you again, Nick!"

I needed a scooter to get around OC after I had surgery to repair a dislocated and broken ankle. It was perfect and it was easy getting around town via the sidewalk or bus. At one point, we lost the key to the scooter...we thought we'd be stranded at the beach for a while but Nick got us a new key in less than 15 minutes...at no extra charge! Hopefully I'll never be injured again but if I am, I'll def be renting from Sand Helper. We wouldn't have been able to have a great trip without renting a scooter from Sand Helper. Worth the money!"

He problem solved for us when we need the sand helper moved and he was most accommodating in resolving issues that I created by parking the sand helper in the wrong place. Nick took care of it and was no issue. Because of the Sand Helper and Nick our vacation was more enjoyable and stress free. Thanks Nick for the awesome service."
