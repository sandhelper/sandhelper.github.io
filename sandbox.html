               <h3>Sand Helper's Story</h3>
               <p class="drop-cap">
                  Surf's up -- we're off to the beach! Everyone! You no longer have to be left behind. With Sand
                  Helper, everyone makes it to the surf's edge. The Sand Scooter, a patent-pending four-wheel-
                  drive electric motorized beach wheelchair, can navigate the beach with ease. You won't believe
                  its capability.
               </p>
               <figure id="inspiration-image">

               <p class="drop-cap">
                  If you're at the beach, you should be able to get onto the beach. This concept is exactly why Sand
                  Helper became a reality. The idea for the Sand Scooter was sparked by one Maryland family's love for
                  the beach. Since the 1950s, the growing extended family has visited Ocean City, Maryland for a
                  vacation every summer, but eventually the grandparents began to struggle walking through the soft
                  sand. After a couple of years and several unpleasant experiences pushing the manually powered beach
                  wheelchairs, one family member decided enough was enough - it was time for some power. After several
                  revisions and countless improvements to the wheelchair over the years, it was realized that the device
                  they had created, which was ready for commercial use, would surely be desired by other beach-goers
                  seeking independence.
               </p>
               <p class="drop-cap">
                  Today, Sand Helper has grown into a noteworthy company, serving plenty of beaches on the East Coast,
                  with persistent plans for expansion. With rental locations in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey,
                  Virginia, the Carolinas, and Florida, beach accessibility continues to take center stage for Sand
                  Helper. Find out how we can serve you by visiting our

                        This sand wheel chair was a game changer. My dad, who is a Vet, would struggle to get to the
                        ocean. He easily got to the water with the use of the sand wheel chair. This company was
                        wonderful to work with. They dropped it off and picked it up. The batteries were dependable.
                        Highly recommend.

                        My sister and I took our handicapped sister and elderly mother to OC last week. Renting a

                        definitely be using them next time we visit OC.

                        We recently used the SandHelper in Ocean City MD for my mother who has Cancer and can not get
                        around very well but really wanted a beach trip with her kids and grandchildren. I can not
                        stress enough how amazing this motorized wheelchair is. This was a game changer for us and
                        completely made our trip. The customer service was amazing, they responded within minutes and
                        were so helpful. we stored the SandHelper in the lobby of our hotel with no problem, it came
                        with 2 batteries and a charger and each battery has an average range of 4 miles. We were at a
                        hotel on the beach, so we didn't even finish the first battery. Seriously, I can not stress
                        enough how amazing this was and will recommend this to literally anyone who asks. It also helps
                        that it was super entertaining for the kids :)

                        The customer service was outstanding. Rented a beach buggy wheel chair for mom shi that she
                        could get to the beach while she was here in OC. prices was simple. Did what they said they
                        would do. We even lost the key and they bought us another one no questions asked and didn't even
                        charge us for it. Highly recommend overall awesome exsperience .

                        I have issues with mobility and when I saw an advertisement for Sand Helper I knew that would
                        definitely help. I rented it for a day to go back and forth to the beach from our rental
                        property. It allowed me to be able to spend more time with my grandchildren. It was so much fun.
                        I will definitely rent next time I come to the beach. It was also great how they bring it right
                        to you and pick it up.

                        We rented a sand helper so that my husband could go on the beach sand where our family was
                        sitting. He rode the sandhelper and was able to spend 3 days enjoying our children,
                        grandchildren, and cousins. He would have been unable to leave the bench on the boardwalk
                        Without the sandhelper. Nick, the designer, owner and renter was exceptionally responsive. He
                        called us back immediately, gave us instructions and answered all our questions. The video,
                        accompanying the site on line gave very cleat instructions. Nick had the sand helper waiting for
                        us on our arrival at our hotel, and he picked it up from our hotel after we left. The sandhelper
                        was also able to be used for walks on the boardwalk. We definitely would recommend renting the
                        sandhelper!

                        This summer, with a recently broken pelvis, I didn’t think that I would be able to join my
                        family at Ocean City, MD for our annual vacation. I looked online and found Sand Helper😃 Nick
                        was wonderful! He made all the arrangements for me to rent a motorized wheelchair for the week.
                        When we arrived at our condominium, I found my wheelchair waiting there for me with a
                        fully-charged battery and a spare one.<br>
                        It was so easy to use and it made it possible for me to spend hours of fun with my family on the
                        beach.<br>
                        I highly recommend Nick and ‘Sand Helper’ for wonderful customer service and an excellent
                        ride!<br>

                        Nick of Sand Helper really saved my bacon on vacation! I needed a key for the electric scooter
                        that I had brought with us, but neglected to remember the key! He was there to save the day
                        within 1 hour of calling him, and our vacation was back on! He came right to our hotel. I cannot
                        recommend this young man and his service highly enough! Why can't they have 6 Stars? Anyone who
                        has mobility issues, or a family member with mobility issues, Sand Helper makes sure that they
                        get to participate in the fun as well! Thank you again, Nick!

                        Last year i went to Ocean City, MD and ended up in tears on the beach because I struggled to
                        walk in the sand due to my disability. I grieved the loss of my beach days. Then this year I
                        returned to Ocean City and found out about Sand Helper. What a joy to find out that my beach
                        days were NOT over - thank you Sand Helper for enabling me to enjoy the beach without struggle
                        and anxiety again!

                        5 stars! Renting from Sand Helper was so easy! Nick was awesome to work with! Very
                        communicative! Fast response and service. I needed a scooter to get around OC after I had
                        surgery to repair a dislocated and broken ankle. It was perfect and it was easy getting around
                        town via the sidewalk or bus. At one point, we lost the key to the scooter...we thought we’d be
                        stranded at the beach for a while but Nick got us a new key in less than 15 minutes...at no
                        extra charge! Hopefully I’ll never be injured again but if I am, I’ll def be renting from Sand
                        Helper. We wouldn’t have been able to have a great trip without renting a scooter from Sand
                        Helper. Worth the money!

                        We rented a Sand Helper in OC MD and were so happy to get my husband to the beach. It was a
                        gift! Your customer service was outstanding and I really appreciate Nick answering all my
                        questions. We will be in Corolla soon and are hopeful to be able to rent a Sand Helper there so
                        my husband will be on the beach with his children and grandchildren. Thank you.

                        I can't say enough about how great Nick was in providing us with a Sand Helper. He took care of
                        our needs with location and relocating the sand helper. He was quick to resolve issue that I
                        actually caused and didn't make an issue to disrupt our vacation. What customer service!!! I
                        only wish people would be as kind and thought full in the service they provide as Nick was to
                        us. Because of Nick our vacation was much more enjoyable and relaxing. Nick, Thank you and keep
                        up the awesome service.

                        Sand Helper is a great product and was so helpful to us so that my sister could enjoy the beach
                        with us. But more importantly was the service that Nick provided. He was such a joy to work with
                        and he helped us through out our stay. He problem solved for us when we need the sand helper
                        moved and he was most accommodating in resolving issues that I created by parking the sand
                        helper in the wrong place. Nick took care of it and was no issue. Because of the Sand Helper and
                        Nick our vacation was more enjoyable and stress free. Thanks Nick for the awesome service.
